Expression-Calc
===================
It is a bit raw, but improvements are already being made.
# execute()
Line is split to numbers and operations(one character at a time). Then multiplication and division are done(). + and - follow. Result is returned
# parser()
output brackets'pairs indices (count number of brackets inside two certain ones(if any))
# The line
Afterwards, the result of previous operations is processed similarly to execute(). Only this time all possible mistakes are checked for and corrected. print(result) :)
