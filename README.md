# Expression-Calc
It is a bit raw, but improvements are already being made.
execute()
line is split to numbers and operations(one character at a time)
Then multiplication and division are done() 
+ and - follow
result is returned
parser()
output brackets'pairs indices
(count number of brackets inside two certain ones(if any))
Afterwards, the result of previous operations is processed similarly to execute()
Only this time all possible mistakes are checked for and corrected
print(result)
:)
